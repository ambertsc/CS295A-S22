# Schedule

_This schedule is tentative and subject to change. It may be a bit ambitious._

[Supplmentary and optional background reading](syllabus.html#textbook) provided when appropriate. 

R&N == _Aritificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach_, Russell and Norvig, 3rd edition.

## References for Unit 1 (Logic)
For the unit on logic you may also want to consult:

* _Category Theory for the Sciences_, Spivak, [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.6946.pdf) 
* _Logic in Computer Science_, Huth and Ryan
* _Logic for Computer Scientists_, Schoening

Huth and Ryan is an excellent introductory text for temporal and epistemic logics, which we will touch on in Unit 3 (agent-based reasoning).

* _Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View_, Part III, Shalizi, [pdf](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf)
